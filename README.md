# pyEVRobots

These are a set of 'competencies' that you need to be able to demonstrate in this unit.
You need to make a copy (fork) of this repository


## Task 1: Basic Movement
Write Python functions to control EV3 motors:

✅ Move forward for 2 seconds
✅ Move backward for 2 seconds
✅ Turn left 90 degrees
✅ Turn right 90 degrees
✅ Move in a square pattern
🔹 Bonus: Make the robot move in a figure-8 pattern

## Task 2: Sensor Integration
✅ Ultrasonic Sensor: Detect an object and stop if it's less than 10 cm away
✅ Color Sensor: Detect different colors and print them to the console
✅ Touch Sensor: Stop the robot when the button is pressed
🔹 Bonus: Display a custom message on the EV3 screen based on sensor input

## Task 3: Obstacle Avoidance
✅ Move forward and stop if an obstacle is detected
✅ If an obstacle is found, turn left or right to avoid it
✅ Resume movement after avoiding the obstacle
🔹 Bonus: Implement a randomised turning direction when avoiding obstacles

## Task 4: Line Following
✅ Use the Color Sensor to follow a black line
✅ Implement a basic proportional control to adjust motor speed
🔹 Bonus: Modify the logic to follow curves smoothly

## Task 5: Returning Home
✅ Make the robot move forward and complete a course
✅ Use the Gyro Sensor to track turns and navigate back to the starting position
🔹 Bonus: Log movement data and print a path summary in the console

## Task 6: Display and Sound
✅ Display sensor values (e.g., distance, color) on the EV3 screen
✅ Make the robot play a custom beep sequence when it completes a task
🔹 Bonus: Program the EV3 to play a short melody

## Task 7: Git & Documentation
✅ Create a GitHub repository for your project
✅ Write a README.md explaining the logic and results for each task
✅ Use meaningful commit messages when updating code
🔹 Bonus: Create a flowchart showing your program's logic

## Final Submission Checklist
✔️ Push all code to GitHub
✔️ Ensure the README.md is clear and detailed
✔️ Each task should have at least one commit
✔️ Test your code before submission
